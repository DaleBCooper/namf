# List of changes in alfa versions

### NAMF-46rc14b d5efaf5d3f18c470ef3e26df1a9d9d1ba515858b
- quick WiFi reconnect (based on info https://johnmu.com/2022-esp8266-wifi-speed/)
- return to 5 measurements from SDS not 10

### NAMF-46rc14a
- stop WiFi when measuring with SDS. It is meant to have lower checksum error rate on software serial
